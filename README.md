# TxtReader
This code read all TxT files from one past,filter them for colluns(read as a vector position), replace the "." for ",", split the values with
"|" because i hant to transforme the csv file in to an excel file so this turns it more easy, and write a csv file from they.
obs: at this time u need to fill most of the variable in the code and run it by hand on, afterward i will update this program by add
a user interface for increase the usage of it.
